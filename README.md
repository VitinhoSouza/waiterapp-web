## Techs:
The web app was built with **React** by **vite** template. Also used:
- **TypeScript** to better define some application data;
- **Eslint** to better formatting and identification of problems in the code;
- **Styled-components** to styling;
- **Axios** to API requests;
- **react-toastify** to displaying toasts;
- **socket.io-client** to to be notified when the server registers a new order.

## Get started:
- With Git installed, in your terminal run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/VitinhoSouza/waiterapp-web.git`;
- Enter the project folder and do: `npm install` or `yarn install`. When all packages are installed, do `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start in development mode;
- To work properly, you must have a server running and on the correct port listening for your requests.
